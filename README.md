# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview: The purpose of this analysis is to provide a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

  ### Data Preprocessing
   - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
      The "Is-Successful" column. 
   
   - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
      The "Name", "Application", "Affiliation", "Classification", "Use Case", "Organization", "Income Amount", "Special Considerations", "Status", and "Ask Amoutn".
   
   - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
      EIN
  
  ### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model   
   - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
      I put three hidden layer (technically two hidden and one output) because it seemed to have a desired effect required by the challenge. 
   
   - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
      Yes, on the first attempt.
   
   - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
      As I previosuly stated, playing with the hidden layers until I found what I needed.
